title: Free Scaps

*Scaps* is now freely available under the GNU Affero General Public License (AGPL). The repository is hosted by GitHub at [scala-search/scaps](https://github.com/scala-search/scaps).

This project is currently developed and maintained at the [Institute for Software](http://ifs.hsr.ch/) by Lukas Wegmann, but contributions are very welcome. If you want to contribute, please check the [issue tracker](https://github.com/scala-search/scaps/issues).

Our goal is to make [scala-search.org](http://scala-search.org) a useful resource for various programming libraries that eases the discovery of existing functionality. On the long run, it should also be possible to create individual instances of Scaps tailored to specific projects.
